# Epigenetic Screening on TRIP Clone
In this repository all code regarding the epigenetic screening on the K562 CRISPR-Cas9 DSB clone#5 with 18 integrations is uploaded. 


## Code is structured in the following script units:
**Script 0: Clone Annotation**\
Characterizing the chromatin environment of the 18 integrations of clone#5.

**Script 1: Parsing QC**\
General quality checks of the sequencing data.

**Script 2: Preprocessing drug screen**\
Mutating sequencing data to large data frame. Adding all relevant annotations.

**Script 3: Indel plots**\
Indel plots of individual drugs can be obtained using this script.

**Script 4: Statistics & Plotting**\
Indel data are normalized and plots are made characterizing the effect of the drugs.

**Script 5: Heatmaps**
- The effect of the drugs on the indel ratio and efficiency change are plotted using heatmaps. 
- Correlation of indel ratio changes with chromatin marks.
- Indel ratio drug dose response plots.
